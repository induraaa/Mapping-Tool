# Keithley Analyser
Interactive KDF Visualisation Tool

A powerful desktop application for exploring and analysing semiconductor wafer test data with intuitive visualisations and rich statistics.

## ✨ Features

🟢 Interactive Wafer Map
Visualise die-level data across the wafer
Zoom, hover, and click to inspect values

📊 Advanced Data Analysis
Built-in statistics (mean, std dev, yield)
Histogram with normal distribution overlay
Scatter plots, yield trends

🎯 Pass/Fail & Limits
Spec limits and production limits
Colour-coded dies (pass / fail / warning)
Continuous heatmap mode

🔍 Detailed Inspection
Click any die to view all measurements
Multi-design (subsite) support

📁 Flexible Input
Supports KDF files from Keithley ACS systems

📤 Export Options
Export wafer maps as images
Export to Excel for further analysis

⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wafer-map-viewer.git
cd wafer-map-viewer
2. Install dependencies
pip install PySide6

▶️ Usage
python wafer_mapper_light.py your_file.kdf

Or simply run:

python wafer_mapper_light.py

Then open a .kdf file from the UI.

## 🧠 How It Works

Parses KDF files into:
Header metadata
Site coordinates (X, Y)
Measurement values per design

Renders:
Wafer layout with spatial accuracy
Colour-coded dies based on limits or value gradients

Provides:
Statistical summaries
Visual analytics panels

🎨 UI Highlights
Clean, modern theme (custom Qt styling)
Smooth zoom and interaction
Responsive layout with multiple panels:
Wafer view
Site detail
Statistics
